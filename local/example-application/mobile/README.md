## üîê Android CI Keystore Handling

This demo Flutter application is designed to be built and tested inside a containerized CI environment.

In CI, the APK is signed and aligned during the **builder stage** using a release keystore (`release.keystore`) and a pair of ADB keys (`adbkey`, `adbkey.pub`) injected via Docker secrets.

**Keystore usage:**
- The keystore is required to produce signed and aligned `APK` and `AAB` artifacts during build.
- These secrets are passed only to the `builder` stage and **not** embedded in the final image (`runner`).
- The keystore used in CI corresponds to the Play Store release key or a temporary one for test builds.

**ADB keypair usage:**
- ADB keys are used to establish trust between the `Appium` test runner and the Android emulator.
- The emulator runs inside a Docker container and loads the matching `adbkey.pub` at boot.
- The test runner must use the corresponding `adbkey` to be authorized.

‚ö†Ô∏è In local development, fallback default keys are generated if no existing ones are found in `~/.android`.

**Secure practice:**
- CI secrets (keystore + ADB keys) are passed securely via `--mount=type=secret` and not retained in the final container layer.
- The images are compatible with both `arm64` and `amd64` architectures.

For more details, see the CI build setup in the parent project or the Dockerfiles under `local/android/`.
