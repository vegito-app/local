**Portable DevContainer Environment for Vegito**

This repository offers a GPU-accelerated, containerized development environment tailored for the Vegito project.  
It includes ready-to-use setups for Android Studio, Firebase emulators, smart contracts with Clarinet, Vault (in dev mode), and GPU tools — all optimized for use inside DevContainers (VS Code, Codespaces, etc.).

> 🔧 Currently supports **NVIDIA GPUs**.  
> 💡 **AMD GPU support is welcome** — your PR could make the difference!  
> 🧠 Built for reproducibility, portability, and extensibility.

It includes support for:

- Android Studio with emulated devices
- Vault in dev mode
- Firebase emulators
- Clarinet devnet (Stacks smart contracts)
- Robot Framework integration tests
- GCloud tools and builder containers

Installation instructions for Debian + NVIDIA drivers on your host are provided [here for NVIDIA](docker/gpu/README.md).

## Usage

Clone this repo and launch the devcontainer in VSCode.  
Run `make help` for available targets.

## Local Docker Based Development Environment + GPU features 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b24c0b6-d77d-45d1-a16d-e8b2b134601b)

Integrate this repository into your project as a folder *local* or *.local* or *dev*, etc ... 

Example using git subtree:

```bash
git subtree add --prefix local https://github.com/vegito-app/devlocal-docker-gpu.git main --squash
```

Depending on other assets of a current project, `tree` should now show something like:

```
dev@94476426acc6:/workspaces/my-project$ tree -L 1 .
.
|-- CHANGELOG.md
|-- Makefile
|-- README.md
|-- application
|-- docs
|-- infra
|-- local  <----- your project now embeds a git subtree folder of this repository
```

Makefile targets are available by including `local.mk` from the top level Makefile:

```Makefile
include local/local.mk
```

# 🧱 DevLocal Docker GPU Stack

Welcome to **DevLocal-Docker**, a fully portable, GPU-accelerated local development stack designed for high-performance Flutter + Android + GPU projects. This stack provides a complete development environment, including Android Studio with emulator support, GPU rendering, server-side rendering with V8Go, and full headless compatibility via Xpra + Xorg.

## 🔧 Setup

```bash
# 1. Build and run the container
make local-android-studio-image-pull
make local-android-studio-docker-compose-sh

# 2. Inside the container, start the display
display-start-xpra.sh

# 3. Access the desktop via browser
http://localhost:5900/
```

## 🖥️ GPU Acceleration (Success Example)

To use GPU acceleration in Docker containers, installation steps are available here: [NVIDIA GPU Docker Setup for Debian Bookworm](docker/gpu)

```bash
DISPLAY=:1 glxinfo | grep -E "renderer|OpenGL"

OpenGL vendor string: NVIDIA Corporation
OpenGL renderer string: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti/PCIe/SSE2
OpenGL core profile version string: 4.6.0 NVIDIA 535.247.01
...
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
make dev
```

This command starts all services defined in `docker-compose.yml`, including:

- the main `dev` container (your shell and workspace),
- the application backend,
- Firebase emulators,
- Clarinet (smart contracts),
- Android Studio,
- Vault (dev mode).

Once the `dev` container is running, you can execute all usual `make` commands **from inside the container**, or use automatic integration if you are in a **VSCode DevContainer**.

> 💡 Tip: You can also launch the project via the "Open in Container" interface in VSCode, which automatically uses `make dev`.

---

## 🔐 GCP Authentication

To interact with cloud infrastructure (Firebase, Terraform, etc.), you need to authenticate.

Use:

```bash
make gcloud-auth-login-sa
```
---

## 🧰 Local Services: Available Commands

Each service started via `docker-compose` has **dedicated `make` commands**. From inside the `dev` container, for example:

```bash
make android-studio-docker-compose-start     # Start Android Studio
make android-studio-docker-compose-logs      # View logs
make android-studio-docker-compose-sh        # Shell into the container
make android-studio-docker-compose-stop      # Stop the service
```

The same logic applies to:

- Clarinet (Clarity contracts)
- Vault (secret storage)
- Firebase Emulators
- The Go backend, etc.

#### Next steps

* Add a VPN and/or SSH container to the container set to provide an integrated entrypoint usable from the internet with minimal configuration.

---

## 💡 Best Practices

- The environment is designed to be **reproducible**, **shared**, and **modular**.
- Feel free to create your own `make` commands or `.mk` files in `` as needed.
- If you have any questions or suggestions for improvement: open an issue or contact the infra team.
