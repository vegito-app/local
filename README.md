**Portable DevContainer Environment for Vegito**

This repository offers a **GPU-accelerated, containerized development environment** tailored for the Vegito project.
It includes ready-to-use setups for Android Studio, Firebase emulators, smart contracts with Clarinet, Vault (in dev mode), and GPU tools — all optimized for use inside DevContainers (VS Code, Codespaces, etc.).

> 🔧 **Currently supports NVIDIA GPUs**.  
> 💡 **PRs for AMD GPU support are welcome!**  
> 🧠 Built for reproducibility, portability, and extensibility.

## Usage

Clone this repo and launch the devcontainer in VSCode.  
Run `make help` for available targets.

---

## Subtree Integration

Integrate this repository into your project as a folder named `local`, `.local`, `dev`, etc.

Example using git subtree:

```bash
git subtree add --prefix local https://github.com/vegito-app/local.git main --squash
```

Depending on your project, `tree` should now show something like:

```
dev@94476426acc6:/workspaces/my-project$ tree -L 1 .
.
|-- CHANGELOG.md
|-- Makefile
|-- README.md
|-- application
|-- docs
|-- infra
|-- local  <----- your project now embeds a git subtree folder of this repository
```

Makefile targets are available by including `local.mk` from the top-level Makefile:

```makefile
include local/local.mk
```

---

## 🧭 Vision

This project serves as the foundation for a powerful dev experience:

- As a **portable open-source kit** for Android/GPU developers
- As a **base layer** for building SaaS platforms:
  - Provision remote GPU-powered Android workspaces
  - Run ephemeral builds/tests with GPU emulation
  - Power SSR previews for design+QA workflows

---

## 🧪 Use Cases

- 🚀 Mobile emulator testing with real OpenGL (no CPU lag)
- 🎥 Flutter + Maps integration preview
- 🧠 ML inferencing with shared GPU
- 🧪 CI pipelines with rendering tests
- ☁️ Remote dev with full graphical support

# 🧱 DevLocal Docker GPU Stack

Welcome to **DevLocal-Docker**, a fully portable, GPU-accelerated local development stack designed for high-performance Flutter + Android + GPU projects. This stack provides a complete development environment, including Android Studio with emulator support, GPU rendering, server-side rendering with V8Go, and full headless compatibility via Xpra + Xorg.

---

## 📦 Components

| Layer           | Stack                                                 |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧰 Base         | Debian 12 + Docker + NVIDIA Container Toolkit         |
| 🧠 GPU          | NVIDIA RTX / CUDA-enabled environment                 |
| 📱 Mobile Dev   | Android SDK, Emulator, Flutter SDK                    |
| 🧠 SSR          | V8Go + React SSR                                      |
| 🎮 GUI Headless | Xorg + Openbox + Xpra with web VNC support            |
| 🧪 Testing      | Automated emulator testing via `glxinfo`, `adb`, etc. |

---

## 🔧 Setup

### 1. Build and run the container

```bash
# 1. Build and run the container
make local-android-studio-image-pull
make local-android-studio-container-sh
```

### 2. Inside the container, start the display

```bash
display-start-xpra.sh
```

### 3. Access the desktop via browser

Open [http://localhost:5900/](http://localhost:5900/) in your web browser.

## 🖥️ GPU Acceleration (Success Example)

To use GPU acceleration in Docker containers, installation steps are available here: [NVIDIA GPU Docker Setup for Debian Bookworm](docker/gpu/README.md).

Verify GPU rendering from inside the container:

```bash
DISPLAY=:1 glxinfo | grep -E "renderer|OpenGL"
```

Expected output (example):

```
OpenGL vendor string: NVIDIA Corporation
OpenGL renderer string: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti/PCIe/SSE2
OpenGL core profile version string: 4.6.0 NVIDIA 535.247.01
...
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
make dev
```

This command starts all services defined in `docker-compose.yml`, including:

- the main `dev` container (your shell and workspace)
- the application backend
- Firebase emulators
- Clarinet (smart contracts)
- Android Studio
- Vault (dev mode)

Once the `dev` container is running, you can execute all usual `make` commands **from inside the container**, or use automatic integration if you are in a **VSCode DevContainer**.

> 💡 Tip: You can also launch the project via the "Open in Container" interface in VSCode, which automatically uses `make dev`.

---

## 🔐 GCP Authentication

To interact with cloud infrastructure (Firebase, Terraform, etc.), you need to authenticate.

Use:

```bash
make gcloud-auth-login-sa
```

---

## 🧰 Local Services: Available Commands

Each service started via `docker-compose` has **dedicated `make` commands**. From inside the `dev` container, for example:

```bash
make android-studio-container-start     # Start Android Studio
make android-studio-container-logs      # View logs
make android-studio-container-sh        # Shell into the container
make android-studio-container-stop      # Stop the service
```

The same logic applies to:

- Clarinet (Clarity contracts)
- Vault (secret storage)
- Firebase Emulators
- The Go backend, etc.

#### Next steps

- Add a VPN and/or SSH container to the container set to provide an integrated entrypoint usable from the internet with minimal configuration.

---

## 💡 Best Practices

- The environment is designed to be **reproducible**, **shared**, and **modular**.
- Feel free to create your own `make` commands or `.mk` files in `local` as needed.
- If you have any questions or suggestions for improvement: open an issue or contact the infra team.
