# Listening docker socket at local TCP 2375 will allow vscode to forward it to your remote editor.

# This is working both on Github Codespaces and on local vscode with the "Remote - Containers" extension.
# Port forwarding is automatically done by vscode when a process is listening.
# This is secure as the socket is only accessible from inside the container and you have an ssh or vscode remote session.

# to match the one used by Codespaces.
# You can ignore this with local vscode "Remote - Containers" extension which is using the same workspace mount as specified

# You can override the default location by setting the LOCAL_WORKSPACE environment variable.
